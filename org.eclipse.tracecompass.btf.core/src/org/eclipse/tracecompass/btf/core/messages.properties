BtfTypeId_CDescr=Hardware device which is part of a processor and executes software.
BtfTypeId_CName=Core
BtfTypeId_ECUDescr=Hardware device which has at least one processor.
BtfTypeId_ECUName=Electronic Control Unit
BtfTypeId_IBDescr=Sub-fraction of a Runnable
BtfTypeId_IBName=Instruction Block
BtfTypeId_ISRDescr=Object handled by Interrupt-Management Unit and calling all \u201CTop-Level\u201D Runnables. An ISR is the specialization of a Process type.
BtfTypeId_ISRName=Interrupt-Service-Routine
BtfTypeId_PDescr=Hardware device which has at least one core.
BtfTypeId_PName=Processor
BtfTypeId_RDescr=Object, called by a Process or another Runnable.
BtfTypeId_RName=Runnable
BtfTypeId_SCHEDDescr=Part of operating system which assigns processes to cores.
BtfTypeId_SCHEDName=Scheduler
BtfTypeId_SEMDescr=Operating system object, for restricting access to resources.
BtfTypeId_SEMName=Semaphore
BtfTypeId_SIGDescr=Shared data object (e.g. variable) in a software.
BtfTypeId_SIGName=Signal
BtfTypeId_SIMDescr=Trigger point for a Task or ISR
BtfTypeId_SIMName=Simulation
BtfTypeId_STIDescr=Trigger point for a Task or ISR
BtfTypeId_STIName=Stimulus
BtfTypeId_TDescr=Object handled by OS Scheduler, and calling all "Top-Level" Runnables. A Task is the specialization of a Process type.
BtfTypeId_TName=Task
BTFPayload_Activate=Process instance is activated by a stimulus
BTFPayload_BoundedMigration=When last executing core of previous instance is not equal to first executing core of this instance
BTFPayload_EnforcedMigration=When a process migrates at a predefined position in execution to another scheduler.
BTFPayload_FullMigration=When the executing core before a suspend is not equal to new executing core and there is a schedule point right before this execution
BTFPayload_MapLimitExceeded=When there are more process instances of this process as the MPA-LIMIT value (MPA = MultipleProcessActivation)
BTFPayload_Park=Active waiting process instance is suspended by another process.
BTFPayload_PhaseMigration=When the executing core before a suspend is not equal to the new executing core and there is no schedule point right before this execution
BTFPayload_Poll=Process instance has requested a resource by polling (active waiting) which is not available
BTFPayload_PollParking=Parking process instance is allocated to the core and again polls (i.e. actively waits) for a resource.
BTFPayload_Preempt=Executing process instance is stopped by the scheduler, e.g. because of a higher priority process which is activated.
BTFPayload_Release=OS EVENT which was requested by a process is set (see OSEK 2.2.3 Extended Task Model, SET_Event()) and process is ready to proceed execution.
BTFPayload_ReleaseParking=Resource which is requested by parking process instance becomes available, but parking process stays suspended and changes to READY state.
BTFPayload_Resume=Suspended process instance continues execution on the same or other core.
BTFPayload_Run=Process instance resumes execution after polling (i.e. active waiting) for a resource
BTFPayload_Start=Process instance is allocated to the core and starts execution for the first time
BTFPayload_Terminate=Process instance has finished execution
BTFPayload_Wait=Process has requested a non-set OS EVENT (see OSEK 2.2.3 Extended Task Model, WAIT_Event() ).
