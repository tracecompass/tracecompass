= Overview =
The Linux Tools Trace Viewer is a stand-alone application based on Eclipse's
Rich Client Platform (RCP). The purpose of this is to provide a lightweight
application to view and analyze traces. It includes all TMF (Tracing and
Monitoring Framework) features, as well as all features from the LTTng (Linux
Tracing Toolkit next generation) Eclipse integration, which are provided by the
Linux Tools Project.

= Getting Started =
To start the Linux Tools Trace Viewer, go to the directory where the Trace
Viewer is installed and then run the application named '''traceViewer'''.
During startup, the Trace Viewer will create, if necessary, an Eclipse workspace
in the user's home directory with the name ''.traceviewer''. It also creates, if
needed, a default tracing project called ''Tracing''.

Now the application can be used as described in the User Guide for Linux Tools
LTTng integration (see section [[#References | References]]).
